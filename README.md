by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/)
The creative house is a project built with basics web development skills. The application is a place to people share ideas to pass a time at home, alone or with family, relatives or friends.
The application was built in quarantine, to other people enjoy the quarantine (at the time when Creative House was being developed, the world was passing through a Covid-19 quarantine).
